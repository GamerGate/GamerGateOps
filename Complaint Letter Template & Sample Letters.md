# Complaint Letter Template & Sample Letters

## Complaint Letter Template:
* Open with "Dear <name, last name>," or "Dear <Mr./Ms. last name>," optionally followed by their position and company name.
* Apologize if the email has been sent to the wrong address, and ask to have it redirected to the right one if so.
* Note that you have some serious concerns about the site(s) theyâ€™re advertising on.
* State how you ran into the article(s) in question, how you felt when you read them, and how they insult, attack, and/or offend you, given your background, tastes, and values.
* Illustrate your point with some quotes. Don't overemote. Be polite but firm about your protest.
* Talk about the advertiser's products and services, mentioning any purchases you made from them in the past and/or planned purchases for the near future. Mention what you like about their products and services.
* State that they would benefit from distancing themselves from outlets creating negative associations with their products and services.
* It's up to you whether you want to give an ultimatum of ending your commercial relationship with the advertiser. Not saying so is OK as long as you've said the above. In fact, admitting that you like their products and services too much to give them up can be sincere and disarming, as long as you warn them that other consumers may feel otherwise.
* End with your name, pseudonym, or sign-off.
