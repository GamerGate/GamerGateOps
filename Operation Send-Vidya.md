# Operation Send-Vidya

Nvidia is said to be strongly considering pulling their ads from Kotaku.

They also advertise on at least Rock, Paper, Shotgun, and possibly other corrupt gaming publications.

Now is the time to email them and inform them of exactly why they should pull their ads from all corrupt gaming publications. Tell them that these publications collude anti-competitively and ideologically to perpetrate anti-gamer hate, that there is a consumer revolt against them, and that severing ties with them would be a selling point, especially during the holiday season. Feel free to extend this message further with other personal points, but these points are key.

The worst offenders, which you should encourage Nvidia to pull ads from and/or not advertise in going forward, are below. It's up to you whether you only want to mention their current and confirmed advertising platforms (Kotaku and Rock, Paper, Shotgun) or all of the worst offenders.
